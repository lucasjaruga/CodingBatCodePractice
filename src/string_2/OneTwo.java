Given a string, compute a new string by moving the first char to come after the next two chars, so "abc" yields "bca". Repeat this process for each subsequent group of 3 chars, so "abcdef" yields "bcaefd". Ignore any group of fewer than 3 chars at the end.

oneTwo("abc") → "bca"
oneTwo("tca") → "cat"
oneTwo("tcagdo") → "catdog"
